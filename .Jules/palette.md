## 2025-05-15 - [Keyboard Navigation for Narrative Choices]
**Learning:** For interactive narrative applications, providing numerical keyboard shortcuts (1-9) for choices significantly improves immersion and accessibility. Discoverability is key, so visual hints like `[n]` should be included next to choice labels.
**Action:** Always consider keyboard shortcuts for multi-choice navigation in interactive media components. Use global listeners with appropriate lifecycle cleanup and state guards.

## 2025-05-15 - [Consistent Localization for UX]
**Learning:** Mixed-language interfaces (e.g., French and English) can be confusing and appear unpolished. Ensuring all UI labels follow a consistent language (English, as per repository standards) improves the overall user perception and accessibility.
**Action:** When touching a component with hardcoded strings in a language that deviates from the project standard, take the opportunity to localize them to the standard language.
