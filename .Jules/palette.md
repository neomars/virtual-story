## 2025-05-15 - Keyboard shortcuts for narrative choices
**Learning:** Adding keyboard shortcuts (1-9) for narrative choices in "Choose your own adventure" games significantly improves the "flow" and delight for users, as it allows for rapid decision-making without reaching for the mouse. Discoverability is key, so visual hints (e.g., `[1]`) should be provided.
**Action:** Always consider keyboard shortcuts for multi-choice interactive elements and ensure they are visually indicated for discoverability.
